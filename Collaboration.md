# Meetings 

## Meeting 1 - 26th of feb
We met face-to-face in tutorial. We threw around ideas for a plugin and narrowed it down to a taggable bookmarks plugin.  

We then disscussed popential features and bonus features that we could implement, as well as a way to distribute work.  

We created this shared git group repo to keep track of code/note artifacts.

We will communicate primarily over slack, it's a chat tool that works on many platforms and has some cool integrations with tools such as git.

## Future meetings
We will probably meet online via Slack for implementation and weekly during tutorial face-to-face to catch up on everything.  
We haven't determined the exact time that we will meet up, it may be spontaneously depending on when we implement things.
