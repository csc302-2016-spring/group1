Planning be here.

TEAM WORK:
- via issue tracking:  
https://github.com/csc302-2016-spring/group1/issues

- via slack  
- 

What did you build during this phase?


High-level design of your software.


Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.

- launching FF with plugin would erase the profile, had to launch with special params. 
- had to enable unsigned plugins for ff.


Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what  needs improvement.

Triage: What will you build for the final demo?
